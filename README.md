Paste the following link in the **Add-On Modules** tab in the **Install Module** Section and click install.
`https://github.com/NekroDarkmoon/exandriafvtt/releases/latest/download/module.json`.


#### How do I import the data into my world?
To properly import the compendiums open each compendium and use the "import folder structure" feature provided by **Compendium Folders**. Though it is recommended to just import the particular creature, scene or journal entry as you need them so as to keep the total file size of your world small.
